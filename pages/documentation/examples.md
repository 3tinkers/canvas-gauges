Canvas Gauges are **highly configurable**. So you may use your fantasy to draw variety of gauges of different look and feel, displaying different kind of information.

**All gauges on this page are interactive. Click the gauge to get it's code. Mouse over to animate (or touch and wait for animation on mobile devices).**

## Zero Configuration Gauges

Minimum declaration!

{% include examples/zero-configuration.html %}

## Radial Gauges as Compass

Compass wanted?

{% include examples/compass.html %}


## Other Custom Radial Gauges

A bit more custom views:
